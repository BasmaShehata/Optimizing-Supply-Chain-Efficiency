# Optimizing-Supply-Chain-Efficiency
# Overview
A Power BI dashboard optimizing supply chain efficiency by analyzing supplier performance, production efficiency, inventory evaluation, order fulfillment, shipping & logistics, and sales overview. Visuals highlight key interdependencies, track performance metrics, and provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making, reduce inefficiencies, and improve supply chain resilience. Ideal for supply chain managers to monitor operations and drive strategic improvements.
# Visuals Included
In this project, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of the supply chain to assess performance, identify inefficiencies, and drive improvements that directly impact operational excellence and sales performance. The analysis was divided into six key phases:

**1. Supplier Evaluation**
Analyzed supplier performance based on:

- Number of suppliers

- Average lead time and its variance

- Total quantity supplied

- On-time delivery rate

- Supplier efficiency per supplier

I also evaluated the quantity received on time by product type and tracked order delivery (on time vs. late) to assess supplier reliability. This helped identify high-performing suppliers and areas for procurement improvement to reduce delays and ensure consistent production flow.

**2. Production Evaluation**
Assessed production operations using:

- Defect rate

- Production volume

- Manufacturing cost

- Average manufacturing lead time

- Supplier order quantities

Data was broken down by product type to monitor quality trends, align supplier deliveries with production needs, and reduce manufacturing costs through better planning. This phase helped increase production efficiency while maintaining quality.

**3. Inventory Evaluation**
Evaluated inventory performance through:

- Stock availability

- Stock levels across warehouses

- Inventory turnover ratio

- Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)

- Stock-out rate

Linked inventory levels to sales and production volumes by product type. The goal was to optimize inventory, reduce excess stock, and improve stock availability to meet demand with minimal delays or losses.

**4. Order Fulfilment**
Analyzed order cycle times and fulfillment efficiency by tracking:

- Fastest, slowest, and average order cycle

- On-time delivery rate

- Order volume per month

- Fulfillment time by product type

Explored factors affecting order fulfillment and aligned production with order volumes per warehouse. The outcome was reduced delivery times, improved order accuracy, and better customer satisfaction.

**5. Shipping And Logistics**
Monitored shipping efficiency and cost-effectiveness through:

- Average shipping times by transportation mode and carrier

- Shipping cost per carrier

This helped identify the most reliable and cost-effective logistics partners and improve last-mile delivery performance while reducing logistics expenses.

**6. Summary**
Each component is interconnected, forming a continuous feedback loop. A weak supplier disrupts production, leading to inventory shortages, order delays, and logistical inefficiencies. Conversely, an optimized evaluation process ensures a smooth, cost-effective, and reliable supply chain, improving customer satisfaction and business profitability.

**7. Sales Overview**
Measured business impact via:

- Average price

- Total sales, cost, and profit

- Profit margin

- Quantity sold

- Total number of orders

Also analyzed sales performance by product category, linked it with inventory turnover, and identified high-profit, high-demand products. This connected operational improvements with financial outcomes.
**Impact on Sales**
The comprehensive improvements across sourcing, production, inventory, fulfillment, and logistics resulted in:

- Faster lead times and smoother operations

- Higher product availability

- Reduced stock-outs and production delays

- Lower operational costs

- Better customer experience

This directly contributed to increased sales volume, improved profit margins, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
# Data Processing, Model View, and Calculations

This Power BI dashboard leverages several key tools and technologies to perform data transformations and calculations:

- **Power Query:** Used for data importation and transformation, Power Query enables the cleaning, shaping, and loading of data from various sources into the Power BI environment. This process ensures that the data is in the correct format for analysis.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** DAX is utilized for creating custom calculations and measures within the dashboard. It allows for advanced data modeling and enables the creation of dynamic calculations that respond to user interactions and filter selections.

- **Data Modeling:** The relationships between different data tables are established to create a comprehensive data model. This ensures accurate insights and visualizations throughout the dashboard.
